## Where every quest stands, for the whole game: an autoload, so it outlives stage changes and
## respawning; GameManager writes it into the save file. The quests themselves (QuestData, .tres)
## never change while the game runs — their state lives here, in two Dictionaries:
##   states:   quest id -> "active" | "completed" | "turned_in"   (not in it = not taken yet)
##   progress: quest id -> [count, ...]                           (one count per objective)
## Progress comes from EventBus: enemies and pickups report what happened, and the objectives of
## the ACTIVE quests that match count it.

## A quest was taken, advanced, completed or turned in. "" = everything was reset or reloaded.
